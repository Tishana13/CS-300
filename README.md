# CS 300 Module Eight Journal

## Overview
In this module, I have worked on two projects that have enhanced my understanding of data structures and algorithms. This journal serves as a reflection of my learning experiences and a submission for my portfolio.

Project One: Run-Time and Memory Analysis
For Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory efficiency of various data structures used within our applications. This involved evaluating different algorithms and their performance under various conditions.

Project Two: Course Sorting Program
In Project Two, I developed a working code to sort and print a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. This project reinforced my understanding of data handling and manipulation.

### Reflection Questions

1. **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
   In these projects, I aimed to understand how different data structures operate, particularly run-time efficiency and memory usage. The goal was to develop a solid foundation for efficiently managing data in real-world applications.

2. **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are essential to understand.**
   I approached the problem by researching various data structures and their typical use cases. Understanding data structures is crucial because they provide the backbone for organizing and manipulating data effectively, allowing for optimal performance in software development.

3. **How did you overcome roadblocks during the activities or project?**
   One significant roadblock I faced was with the CSV files in Project Two. I encountered issues opening and reading the CSV file correctly. To overcome this, I meticulously checked the file path and format, ensuring it was structured correctly for my program to parse. Additionally, I used debugging techniques, such as inserting print statements to trace the data flow and verify the loaded information's integrity.

4. **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
   My work on these projects has expanded my approach by emphasizing the importance of selecting the proper data structure for specific problems. I have learned to consider both my code's performance implications and maintainability during the design phase.

5. **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
   I have adopted best practices for writing clean code through these projects, such as meaningful variable names, comments, and modular functions. These practices make my programs more accessible to read, maintain, and adapt to changes in requirements over time.
